## Purpose

This package contains the service layer — all business logic sits here, keeping routers thin. Services receive an `AsyncSession` and Pydantic schemas, perform database operations within transactions, and raise `HTTPException` on errors.

## Files

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| [`__init__.py`](__init__.py) | Package marker. |
| [`profile_service.py`](profile_service.py) | Top-level profile operations. **`list_profiles()`** — returns all users ordered by creation date. **`create_profile()`** — inserts a `User` and all child records (educations, work experiences, projects, skills) in a single transaction; rolls back and returns `409` on duplicate email. **`get_profile()`** — loads a user with all relationships via `selectinload`; returns `404` if not found. **`update_profile()`** — updates scalar user fields and replaces child lists (clear + re-insert) in one transaction. **`delete_profile()`** — deletes the user; cascade removes all children. |
| [`education_service.py`](education_service.py) | Individual education CRUD operations scoped to a profile. **`list_educations()`** — returns all educations for a profile, ordered by `start_date` descending. **`create_education()`** — adds a single education entry. **`update_education()`** — partial update using `exclude_unset=True`, validates `graduate_date >= start_date` after applying changes. **`delete_education()`** — removes a single education entry. |
| [`work_experience_service.py`](work_experience_service.py) | Individual work experience CRUD scoped to a profile. Same pattern as education_service. Supports the `is_remote` field. Validates `end_date >= start_date` on update. |
| [`project_service.py`](project_service.py) | Individual project CRUD scoped to a profile. Same pattern as education_service. Validates `end_date >= start_date` on update. |
